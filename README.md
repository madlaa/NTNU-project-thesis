# NTNU-project-thesis
Repository description
------
Project thesis written during the fall of 2016 as part of the course "TTK4550 Teknisk kybernetikk, fordypningsprosjekt" at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). This course corresponds to a workload of 15 ECTS credits, equivalent to half a semesters workload. The project thesis is titled "Robotic rehabilitation of upper-limb after stroke" and it received a grading score of B.

Abstract
------
Globally, stroke is one of the main causes of permanent neurological damage and death[18]. Partial or total paralysis in the extremities is the most common complication after a stroke, with paralysis in upper-limbs being the most prevalent. Efficient and readily available rehabilitation therapy is essential for the recovery process. General physical therapy is a common approach, but resource intensive. Research on robotic rehabilitation aims to provide a viable alternative.

The motivation for this thesis is to contribute in the design of a rehabilitation robot, based on a standard robot manipulator, aimed at rehabilitation of stroke patients with paralyzed upper-limbs.

The main objective is to design a robotic simulation environment for testing and analysis of robotic rehabilitation strategies. Secondary objectives include identification of implementation challenges, and suggesting feasible solutions.

A review of relevant simulation software is presented. The recommended candidate is used to create a robotic simulation environment for the Universal Robots UR5 manipulator. The resulting simulation environment proved to be insufficient for the requirements of the robotic rehabilitation project. The main challenge identified was limitations in available control inputs within a robotic software driver, because the driver does not facilitate force control. Suggested solutions, alternative software drivers and improvements to the simulation environment are also presented.

Several implementation challenges are identified and partially solved including; programming platform, firmware limitations, unwanted controller behavior, wrist mounting, patient criteria and minimal sampling rate.
